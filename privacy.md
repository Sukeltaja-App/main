#### Data we collect

Sukeltaja-app will collect data from events and dives created in the app.
This data is stored in a database and provided to users participating the same event. Other participants can see your dives, including your diving location. By default, the diving location is the location of the event. You are able to update this to your own, exact location if you want.
